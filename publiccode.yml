    shortDescription: Library for Server-Sent Events in jEAP applications, using SSE and Kafka
    longDescription: >
      The jEAP Server-Sent Events (SSE) library enables real-time, server-to-client
      event streaming over HTTP using the SSE standard. It provides a configurable
      web endpoint where UI clients can subscribe to receive events such as resource
      creation, updates, deletions, and periodic heartbeat signals. Multiple backend
      instances are synchronized via Kafka to ensure all connected clients receive all
      relevant events, regardless of which instance initiated the change. The library
      offers flexible authentication options, including insecure, simple role-based,
      and semantic resource/operation-based access control. It exposes a simple
      business logic API (`ResourceMutationService`) for publishing events and handles
      dispatch to all listeners automatically. With configurable heartbeat rates,
      emitter timeouts, and Kafka topics, it supports scalable, efficient, and secure
      integration of real-time updates into jEAP-based microservices and UI applications.
    features:
      - Providing real-time data change updates to web frontends using Server-Sent Events (SSE)
      - Synchronizing multiple backend instances via Kafka to ensure consistent event delivery
      - Configurable authentication options for secure access control
      - Simple API for publishing resource change events
      - Flexible configuration for heartbeat rates, emitter timeouts, and Kafka topics
